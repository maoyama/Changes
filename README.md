# Changes - An Open Source GUI Git Client for macOS

Changes.app is a modern Git client for Mac, built with SwiftUI and AppKit and styled with Apple’s new Liquid Glass design.  
It replaces complex CLI commands with a clear, Mac-native interface that keeps cognitive load low, so you can focus on what really matters—coding.  
With commit message generation powered by Apple Intelligence, creating clear and meaningful commits becomes effortless.
